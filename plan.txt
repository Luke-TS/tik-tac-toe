This file contains a brainstorm of development steps.

tic-tak-toe:
- create basic gui
    - grid of buttons
        - use code from previous etch-a-sketch-project
    - add button functionality
        - should return location data to corresponding play

- variables and data
    - create 2d arrays for each player
        - arrays correspond to board layout
    - create some array to store available spaces
        - user inputs should be checked before adding
    - array of win-conditions
        - should contain all possibilities
        - will need an algorithm to expand to larger boards

- checking for wins
    - function should be checked after every button press
    - should look for win conditions within user data
